    "Mastery of the learning material is demonstrated, original ideas may be presented. The scientific question is well posed, creative and interesting. The correct method is proposed. Thesis is clear and the arguments that support it are flawless and very well-reasoned, leaving no obvious gaps. Structure of argument is very clear and straightforward; the reader almost never has to jump back and forth unless clearly instructed to do so by references."
